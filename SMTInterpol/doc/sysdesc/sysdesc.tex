\section*{Description}
\SI is an SMT solver written in Java and available under LGPL v3.
It supports the combination of the theories of uninterpreted functions, arithmetic over integers and reals, arrays, and datatypes.
Furthermore it can produce models, proofs, unsatisfiable cores, and interpolants.
The solver reads input in SMT-LIB format.
It includes parsers for DIMACS, AIGER, and SMT-LIB version 2.6.

The solver is based on the well-known DPLL(T)/CDCL framework~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/GanzingerHNOT04}.
It uses variants of standard algorithms for CNF conversion~\cite{DBLP:journals/jsc/PlaistedG86} and congruence closure~\cite{DBLP:conf/rta/NieuwenhuisO05}.
The solver for linear arithmetic is based on Simplex~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/DutertreM06}, the sum-of-infeasibility algorithm~\cite{DBLP:conf/fmcad/KingBD13}, and branch-and-cut for integer arithmetic~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/ChristH15,DBLP:conf/cav/DilligDA09}.
The array decision procedure is based on weak equivalences~\cite{DBLP:conf/frocos/ChristH15} and includes an extension for constant arrays~\cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/HoenickeS19}.
The decision procedure for data types is based on the rules presented in~\cite{DBLP:journals/jsat/BarrettST07}.
The decision procedure for bit-vectors uses the int-blasting technique~\cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/ZoharIMNNPRBT22,DBLP:conf/smt/BarthH24}.
The solver for quantified formulas performs an incremental search for conflicting and unit-propagating instances of quantified formulas~\cite{DBLP:conf/vmcai/HoenickeS21} which is complemented with a version of enumerative instantiation~\cite{DBLP:conf/tacas/ReynoldsBF18} to ensure completeness for the finite almost uninterpreted fragment~\cite{DBLP:conf/cav/GeM09}.
Theory combination is performed based on partial models produced by the theory solvers~\cite{DBLP:journals/entcs/MouraB08}.
\SI comes with a proof production~\cite{DBLP:conf/smt/HoenickeS22} that is based on resolution using a minimal set of axioms.

The main focus of \SI is the incremental track.
This track simulates the typical application of \SI where a user asks multiple queries.
As an extension, \SI supports interpolation for all supported theories~\cite{DBLP:journals/jar/ChristH16,DBLP:conf/cade/HoenickeS18,DBLP:conf/vmcai/HoenickeS19,DBLP:conf/smt/HenkelHS21}.  It computes quantifier-free interpolants for quantifier-free input formulas.
This makes it useful as a backend for software verification tools.
In particular, \textsc{Ultimate Automizer}\footnote{\url{https://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/}} and \textsc{CPAchecker}\footnote{\url{https://cpachecker.sosy-lab.org/}}, the winners of the SV-COMP 2016--2025, used \SI.

\SI aims for producing witnesses (proofs and models).  The competition version will check these witnesses before reporting the result to ensure soundness.  Only sat results for quantified logics are not checked.

\section*{Competition Version}
The version of \SI submitted to the SMT-COMP 2025 contains
new experimental technique for propagating equalities in linear arithmetic.
Also the DPLL core engine was changed to not decide on literals that
are currently not watched by any clause.

\SI participates in all tracks: the single query track, the incremental track, the unsat core track, and the model validation track.
It supports all combinations of uninterpreted functions, arithmetic, arrays, datatypes, bit-vectors, and quantified formulas.
However, the model generator currently does not support quantifiers.

\SI participates in the logics matched by
